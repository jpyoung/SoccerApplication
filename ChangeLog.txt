10-25-2012 - Change Log -- Need to submit to designers for approval. 

#1
The UML class diagram specified the following. "+setUserObject(): void".
- Problem. Nothing is being passed into the set method, as a result you cant set a user object in the UserCredentials class.
- Change. +setUserObject(String userName, String password, int userType, User iUser): void
	This will allow for a userobject to be set, along with its given fields. 

#2
The UML class diagrams did not give any means for getting the Arraylist's in this class.
- Changes.   Added 5 new getter methods to the UserCredentials class.  
	+getUserNamesArraylist(): ArrayList<String> 
	+getPasswordsArraylist(): ArrayList<String>
	+getIdArraylist(): ArrayList<Integer>
	+getUserTypeArraylist(): ArrayList<Integer>
	+getUserObjectArraylist(): ArrayList<User> 

#3
- Problem. There is absolutely no way to reset a already set password in the UserCredentials class
- Change. Added the below method to the UserCredentials class. 
	public void setPassword(int userIndex, String newPassword) {
		getPasswordsArraylist().set(userIndex, newPassword);
	}
- Now when a user goes to edit their profile, and they select the option to update their password.  They will now be able to actually update 
their password.  



#4
	//just added - not specified in the uml
	private int countOfAllTeams = 0;
	public int getCountOfAllTeams() {
		return this.countOfAllTeams;
	}
	
	
#5
Added an Arg's constructor to the Team class.  This will yield the depicted bi-directional relationship between the Team and Coach class.  



#6  Added the following method so the Roster class.
The problem was that a coach could add a player, but by doing so the coach could only see that the roster count increment. so that can access the individual player fields
-Solution: I added the below method so that when a coach adds a player to his or her roster, they can also now access that players information
	/**
	 * just created 10-27
	 * @return the roster
	 */
	public Player[] getPlayersOnRoster() {

		Player[] arr = new Player[roster.size()];
		Iterator<Player> iterator = roster.iterator();
		int counterr = 0;
		while(iterator.hasNext()) {
			arr[counterr] = iterator.next();
			counterr++;
		}

		return arr;
	}


---If You Need to Make Any changes, place your notes & remarks below ---------



#7 Added new class called Notifications to the Models
#8 Created a Inbox Class
#9 The Player class will have a new field called inbox



---after first email----

#10  added the below methods to the coaches class
	private boolean hasTeam = false;
	public boolean getHasTeam() {
		
		if (getTeam().getName() == null) {
			hasTeam = false;
		} else {
			hasTeam = true;
		}
		
		return hasTeam;
	}
	public void setHasTeam(boolean r) {
		hasTeam = r;
	}
	
#11 added the below to the coaches class
private boolean payLeagueFees = false;

	public boolean getPayLeagueFees() {
		return payLeagueFees;
	}
	public void setPayLeagueFees(boolean l) {
		this.payLeagueFees = l;
	}

-----------Major Change
-The project description had mentioned that a captain is a player, and how they they have the same user abilities as a Coach.  But given the data modal design
this will not be possible.  As such, we have gear this application towards three types of users. 
1 - Official
2 - Coach
3 - Player


-- gonna remove their valdiation methods in the usercredientials class: change its return type to boolean
